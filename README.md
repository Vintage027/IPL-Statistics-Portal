<h1> IPL Statistics Portal üèè </h1>

<h4> IPL and its significance in cricket </h4>

The Indian Premier League (IPL) is a men's Twenty20 (T20) cricket league held annually in India. Founded by the BCCI (the Board of Control for Cricket in India) in 2007, the league features ten state or city-based franchise teams. The IPL 
usually takes place during the summer, between March and May each year. 

<h4>Existing platforms that provide IPL statistics </h4>

Several platforms provide detailed statistics for the Indian Premier League (IPL). These platforms are valuable for 
analysts, and professionals looking to get detailed insights into player performances, team statistics, and match
outcomes. Here are some of the main platforms:

<ul type="square">    
<li>ESPNcricinfo</li>
<li>IPL Official Website</li>
<li>Cricbuzz etc.</li>
</ul>    

* Problem Definition:
  
 1: Lack of advanced analytical tools:

Current IPL stats platforms are valuable but can be enhanced with advanced analytics. By adding visualization tools, and customization options, users can gain deeper insights and improve their experience.
Solution: A Prediction Model is available in the project, Which helps to predict a winner among the selected two teams. And also Statistical data is present which is easy to understand

 2: Limited user interactivity and customization options:

The existing IPL stat platforms lack interactivity and customization, hindering user engagement. Enhancing with advanced visualizations and filters can vastly improve user experience and broaden appeal.
Solution: This Mini project solves the problem by adding various options such as ‚ÄúMost Wins Team‚Äù,  ‚ÄúOrange Cap Player‚Äù, ‚ÄúPurple Cap Player‚Äù and so on. Thus, user an access all the information.
